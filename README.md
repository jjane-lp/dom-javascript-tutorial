## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues:**

**"Nothing happens when I click"**
- Check if JavaScript is enabled
- Look for typos in function names
- Use browser developer console to see errors

**"Can't find element"**
- Verify IDs and classes match exactly
- Ensure element exists when JavaScript runs
- Use `console.log()` to debug selections

**"Styles don't apply"**
- Check CSS property names (camelCase in JS)
- Verify values are strings when needed
- Use developer tools to inspect applied styles

**"Events don't work"**
- Ensure event listeners are added after DOM loads
- Check for typos in event names
- Verify callback functions exist

### **Debugging Tools:**
```javascript
// Essential debugging commands
console.log(element);        // Check if element exists
console.log(element.value);  // Check input values
console.log(typeof variable); // Check data types
```
